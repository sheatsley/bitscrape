## Bitscrape

This is *Bitscrape* - a repo containing a collection of cool pixel art that I
use for wallpapers. Most of them have been collected from
[8bitdash](http://www.8bitdash.com), so thanks to
[Jendrick](https://www.madewithtea.com) for putting such an awesome collection
together. 

The collection features public works from
[Kirokaze](https://www.deviantart.com/kirokaze),
[Valenberg](https://www.deviantart.com/valenberg), and [Mark
Ferrari](http://www.markferrari.com). Also, there are handful pieces of art I
have encountered through random internet travels from
[supervisual](https://www.reddit.com/user/supervisual/),
[1ENi1](https://www.reddit.com/user/1Eni1/),
[JimmyJ4zz](https://www.reddit.com/user/JimmyJ4zz/), and
[aleha_84](https://www.reddit.com/user/aleha_84/).

## How to use this repo
Requirements:
- Python 3

The art stored here are simple gifs of relatively small size. Thus, a simple
clone is sufficient to obtain all the art. If [8bitdash](www.8bitdash.com) ends
up added a significant amount of additional art, the resources may not be able
to be directly stored here. Simply running ```python3 scrape.py``` will obtain
the lastest pieces of art.
